# Time-and-Space-Complexity-Analyses-for-The-UCI-Appliances-Energy-Prediction
## Abstract
â€”A good generator network for time-series data must
have the ability to keep track of the progression of time. This
indicates that new patterns ought to follow the fundamental
linkages that have existed between components over the course of
time. The currently existing methods that integrate adversarial
generative networks (GANs) into a sequence environment do
not pay adequate attention to the periodic connections that are
unique to time-series data. This is a limitation of these methods.
I introduced an architecture for the production of precise timeseries data and presented it to the group. In order to create data
and information that are more reflective of reality, this model
combines the control that is afforded by supervised learning
with the flexibility afforded by an unsupervised setting. This
study also includes the specifics of classic GANs, including their
components, the training procedures, and the difficulties they
provide. Finally, the comparative study of GANs and Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) is given, along with the results of their
performance on the UCI appliances energy prediction dataset.


Follow these steps to run the code
1: Upload code files and dataset to the google driver (Because code file contains deep learning models that are hard to train on local machine)

2: Open code file at google colaboratory (colab)

3: Mount the google drive with google colab and set the path to the dataset

4: Change the runtime of google colab to 'GPU'

5: Run each cell of code
